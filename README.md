# Agentic_AI
This repository is dedicated to learning how to build and deploy Agentic AI systems using LangChain and LangGraph.

## Set up the virtual environment

Prompt: Create a virtual environment with conda in the project directory and use the default python version
Command: conda create -p ./env python

### Activate the environment
Command: conda activate ./env

## Best Practices
- Do not commit the `env` folder to version control. Add `env/` to your `.gitignore` file.
- Use `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml` to specify dependencies for easy setup by collaborators.

## Next Steps
- Install required packages (e.g., LangChain, LangGraph) after activating the environment.
- See `Documentation.md` for more details and best practices.
